## Project 1: Using a Survey Dataset to Identify Factors that Influence Data Reuse Behavior in Research 

   Large amounts of data are being produced in research everyday,
   containing a wealth of valuable information that is not only useful
   for researchers who collected the data, but also for those who did
   not collect the data to extract new information for making data-driven
   decisions or to make new discoveries. However, many hurdles exist that
   prevent existing data from being found and reused, limiting the ability
   of researchers to benefit from reusing data. As a consequence, the value
   of data cannot be fully extracted and tremendous amounts of resources
   (time, money and labor) are wasted. In 2020, a large survey was conducted
   to understand how researchers discover, make sense of, and (re)use data
   for research; the dataset was published in DANS data repository and the
   paper describing the dataset published in Nature Scientific Data.
   Questions asked in the survey explored respondents' data needs, their
   data discovery practices, and their methods for evaluating and making
   sense of secondary data. Some exploratory data analysis has been done
   in a previous publication but a more in-depth analysis is needed to
   help inform research administrators and policy makers in identifying and
   implementing more effective instruments that facilitate data reuse.

   In this project, Breana Valentovish, Xavier Xia, and Xiaohan Liu, and I explored the survey 
   dataset and found patterns that could potentially explain data finding and reuse behavior
   of researchers and research support personnel. The goal of our theory-building research was 
   to analyze the following: 
   1) How do factors such as a researcher's demographic information and their perceptions 
      about sharing and using data influence and contribute to their behavior or success in data reuse? 
   2) Are there any patterns that could help researchers benefit more from reusing data or inform research
      administrators of new ways to facilitate data reuse?
